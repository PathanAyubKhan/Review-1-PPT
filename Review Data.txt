Here‚Äôs a text summary of all the insights and steps from your latest.py file for the Demand Forecasting project:

üì¶ Data Loading & Preparation

Downloaded the M5 Forecasting Accuracy dataset from Kaggle.
Loaded calendar.csv, sell_prices.csv, and sales_train_evaluation.csv.
Used a memory reduction function to optimize large dataframes.
Merged datasets store-wise (e.g., CA_1, TX_1) to avoid memory issues.
Saved merged data as .pkl files for reuse.


üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
General Insights:

Dataset contains 11M+ rows across two stores.
Sales trends show seasonality and growth over time.
FOODS category and FOODS_3 department dominate in frequency.
Data distribution is balanced between CA_1 and TX_1.

Event Impacts:

Events like Easter, Labor Day ‚Üí higher average sales.
Events like Christmas, Thanksgiving ‚Üí lower average sales.
Cultural & Sporting events outperform Religious/National ones.

SNAP Days:

SNAP days positively impact sales in California and Texas.

Price Trends:

Sell prices fluctuate over time for selected items.
Inverse relationship between price and sales (higher price ‚Üí lower sales).

Temporal Patterns:

Weekends (Saturday, Sunday) show higher sales.
July and August have peak monthly averages.

Categorical Analysis:

Sales vary significantly across stores, categories, departments.
CA_1, FOODS, and FOODS_3 lead in average sales.

Outliers:

Box plots reveal outliers in sales and sell prices across all groups.


üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering

Created lag features: sales_lag7, sales_lag14, sales_lag28.
Created rolling mean features: sales_rollmean7, sales_rollmean28.
Split data into train/validation using d_num (day index).


ü§ñ Modeling
Models Used:


LightGBM

Fast, efficient gradient boosting.
RMSE used for evaluation.



XGBoost

Tree-based model with strong performance.
RMSE calculated.



Random Forest

Used for baseline comparison.



LSTM

Captures long-term dependencies in time series.
Trained with 50 epochs and dropout regularization.



GRU

Lightweight alternative to LSTM.
Same training setup as LSTM.




üìà Evaluation

RMSE used across models for validation.
No early stopping applied.
Feature importance not yet explored.


üß† Final Insights & Recommendations
Strengths:

Modular and scalable pipeline.
Deep EDA with actionable insights.
Hybrid modeling approach (ML + DL).
Efficient memory and data handling.
